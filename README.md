# Project Name

Hi ! and thanks for giving me the opportunity to present my test. I tried to be basic and do the code as clean as possible. I like to do simple things and not confuse future developers when they need to add/modify something that i made, so that is my main idea of this.

I used 6hs as were suggested but i will use 1hs extra to make the e2e tests for the pages. In addition i just used 3 of the api's. I did a responsive design but looks very chromatic, can be improved for sure but I would love to have a UX/UI to help me with that.

## Tech Stack

This project uses a modern and efficient stack to ensure fast development and maintainability:

- **React** - The backbone of the UI, making components easy to build and reuse.
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool, perfect for a smooth development experience.
- **Vitest** - A simple and powerful testing framework for unit and component testing.
- **TailwindCSS** - For styling, allowing quick and efficient UI development without writing tons of CSS.
- **Storybook** - Helps in developing and testing UI components in isolation.
- **TypeScript** - Enforces type safety, making the codebase more robust and maintainable.
- **React Table** - Provides efficient table management and enhances performance when dealing with large datasets.
- **Axios** - A lightweight HTTP client for making API requests cleanly and efficiently.
- **Prettier & ESLint** - Ensures code consistency and helps maintain best practices.

## Development Approach

I aimed to keep the code **simple and understandable**, prioritizing clarity and maintainability over complex custom logic. My approach to testing is:

- **Unit testing for all possible components** to ensure reliability.
- **E2E tests for complex pages** to validate workflows without adding unnecessary maintenance overhead.
- **Avoiding excessive customization** to keep the codebase maintainable in the long run.

## Next Steps

If I had more time, I would improve the project in the following ways:

- **Use better SVGs** - I used AI-generated ones to save time, but they could be improved with better-designed assets.
- **Add E2E tests with Cypress** - Currently, testing is limited, but full end-to-end tests would be ideal (probably in a separate repo).
- **Use Next.js instead of Vite for real-world scenarios** - This would improve SEO and provide better SSR capabilities.
- **Implement a usability tracking tool like GA4** - Useful for analyzing user behavior and improving UX.
- **Enhance accessibility** - I kept it simple, but there’s room for improvement.
- **Introduce a context provider** - To avoid unnecessary API calls after additions or edits.
- **Improve UI with better colors and design** - But a proper design system would be needed first.
- **Integrate an error logging tool like Sentry** - To track and analyze issues in production.
- **Create a separate component library** - In a real-world scenario, I’d extract components into a dedicated repository. This would require Webpack 5 for bundling, and since Tailwind doesn’t work well with that setup, switching to Styled Components (or similar) would be necessary. This would allow exporting components individually without bringing in unnecessary CSS.
- **Refactor backend structure (if applicable)** - Given the limited time, I kept it simple. Ideally, I would improve it with proper controllers, models, services, better error handling, and thorough testing.

## Final Thoughts

Thanks for checking it out and the opportunity ! i tried my best in the time that was suggested and not overthink about how to make it better. For sure there are parts that were repeated like edit and add pages that are almost the same, and can be refactored in just one. I hope you have a nice week and I would like to receive a feedback from you positive or negative.
